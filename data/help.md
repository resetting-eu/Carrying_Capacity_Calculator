## Help

**Carrying Capacity Calculator (CCC or C3)** is a fork of [geojson.io](https://geojson.io), extended to be used to calculate walkable areas on a map, and the various stages of Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC), using the methodology proposed by [Cifuentes (1992)](https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/media/www/pag-51898/1992_METODOLOG%C3%8DA%20CIFUENTES.pdf), and used in many tourism contexts. 

### How to use

The tool has the same features of geojson.io. Use the drawing tools to draw areas where you can calculate the walkable area and TCC. After you're done drawing the shapes, you can click them, where a popup appears. In the "Info" tab, you then click the "Calculate carrying capacity" button. When the walkable area calculations are done, a menu appears, where the various stages of TCC can be calculated, with user input (e.g., area per pedestrian, corrective factors, management capacity).

**Note**: You should select areas of reasonable size. The geographic data used in the calculation of walkable areas is fetched with the Overpass API, so the functioning of this tool depends on the fair use and limitations of this free API.
