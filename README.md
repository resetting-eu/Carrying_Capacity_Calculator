# Carrying capacity calculator for pedestrians
## Introduction
This tool calculates the carrying capacities for pedestrians in a user-defined area on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), a free, open geographic database with worldwide coverage, updated and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration.

The carrying capacity for pedestrians is an important issue in several fields such as [tourism destination management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_carrying_capacity), [urban management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22urban+management%22+AND+pedestrians), [events management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar? q=%22events+management%22+AND+pedestrians) (e.g. concerts, music festivals, political rallies, fireworks, plays) and [attractions management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28monument+OR+museum+OR+%22theme+park%22+OR+%22heritage+site%22%29+AND+management+AND+pedestrians) (e.g. monuments, museums, theme parks, archaeological sites).

A paper describing the features of this calculator from an end-user perspective and the algorithm used in this tool is available [HERE](https://dx.doi.org//??????????).

This tool has been developed by the [ISTAR-IUL team](https://sites.google.com/iscte-iul.pt/resetting-project) participating in the [RESETTING project](https://www.resetting.eu/), funded by the [European COSME program](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/cosme_en), managed by [EISMEA (European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency)](https://eismea.ec.europa.eu/index_en), under the COS-TOURINN grant 101038190.
