# Pedestrians Physical Carrying Capacity Calculator
## Introduction
This app calculates the physical carrying capacity for pedestrians in an area defined by the user upon [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), a free, open geographic database with worldwide coverage, updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration.

The physical carrying capacity in terms of pedestrians is an important topic in several areas such as [tourism destinations management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_carrying_capacity), [urban management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22urban+management%22+AND+pedestrians), [events management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22events+management%22+AND+pedestrians) (e.g. concerts, music festivals, political rallies, fireworks, plays) and [attractions management](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28monument+OR+museum+OR+%22theme+park%22+OR+%22heritage+site%22%29+AND+management+AND+pedestrians) (e.g. monuments, museums, theme parks, archaeological sites).

See the [user stories document](UserStories.md) to obtain an informal, natural language description of its features from the perspective of an end user. A short paper describing the algorithm used in this tool is available at (DOI missing).

This tool was developed by the [ISTAR-IUL team](https://sites.google.com/iscte-iul.pt/resetting-project) participating in the [RESETTING project](https://www.resetting.eu/) funded by the [European COSME Programme](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/cosme_en), managed by [EISMEA (European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency)](https://eismea.ec.europa.eu/index_en), under grant COS-TOURINN 101038190.
