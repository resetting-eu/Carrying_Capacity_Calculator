# Pedestrians Physical Carrying Capacity Calculator
## Introduction
This app calculates the physical carrying capacity for pedestrians in an identified area defined upon [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), a free, open geographic database with worldwide coverage, updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration.

The physical carrying capacity in terms of pedestrians is an important topic in several areas such as [tourism destinations management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_carrying_capacity), [urban management](), [events management]() (e.g. concerts, music festivals, political rallies, fireworks, plays) and [attractions managements]() (e.g. monuments, museums, theme parks, archaeological sites)  


See the [user stories document](UserStories.md) to obtain an informal, natural language description of its features from the perspective of an end user.
